# Flem
Flem is a local emulator that makes testing applications written for the App Engine flexible environment easier.  It manages generating docker files, building your containers, and running them in a way that's kinda mostly like running them in production. 

Flem is super ultra expiremental, and under active development.  
**This is a not an official Google project.**
